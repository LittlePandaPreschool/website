                            <p>All Little Panda Childcare Center teachers meet or exceed the California State Department of Education (CADE) licensing requirements. Every year, the teachers must complete a required number of continued training hours. All of the staff have experience working with young children in a supervised program. In addition, our staff members truly love and understand child development and our school’s project-based philosophy.</p>

                            <p>Confidentiality plays a vital role in promoting respect for every individual and fostering a strong community. Little Panda Childcare Center takes confidentiality very seriously and makes every effort to protect each family’s privacy. Communications among staff and parents about children will be kept confidential at all times. Little Panda Childcare Center recommends that conversations about a child, their behavior, or a specific incident should be conducted in private, away from the child and other members of the Little Panda Childcare Center community. If a parent has a question or concern, we suggest that this parent contact the teacher via email or in person to arrange a time to discuss.</p>

                            <p>Germs spread quickly in a preschool environment. All children and staff stay healthier when sick persons stay at home. Common sense must prevail in the case of colds, which can range from a mild case of sniffles to a full-blown sinus infection or deep cough.</p>
                            <p>We use the EMERGENCY FORM, LIC700 to contact parents or any other designated adult if your child develops symptoms of illness while in class. We will isolate your child in a comfortable, supervised place until he/she can be picked up.</p>
                            <p>If a child or family has any symptoms of Covid-19, parents need to inform the school immediately. The child will need to stay home from school until they receive a negative COVID-19 test result, or have quarantined for 14 days. We will follow the guidelines of SFPDHD to amend this protocol if needed.</p>
