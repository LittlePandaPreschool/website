# Progress: Admissions Page Redesign Complete

## Current Status: Dynamic Image Loading Implemented
The `DynamicHero.svelte` and `+page.svelte` components have been updated to dynamically load images from the `/static/img/hero/` and `/static/img/gallery/` directories, respectively. This change eliminates the need for hardcoded image paths and makes the components more maintainable. All known bugs, including the PostCSS errors, have been resolved.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Commit Changes:** The recent design changes and bug fixes need to be committed to a new Git branch.
*   **Final Design Review:** The entire site needs to be tested to ensure all design changes and bug fixes have been applied correctly.
*   **Deployment:** The final, tested site can be deployed to Netlify.

## Known Issues
*   All known issues have been resolved.
