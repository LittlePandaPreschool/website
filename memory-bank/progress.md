# Progress: Admissions Page Redesign Complete

## Current Status: Admissions Page Redesign Complete
The admissions page has been completely redesigned with a more interactive and visually consistent layout. The "Extended Care" and "Our Growth Tiers" sections now use a reusable `InfoCard` component with a green background, white text, and hover effects. All known bugs, including the PostCSS errors, have been resolved.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Commit Changes:** The recent design changes and bug fixes need to be committed to a new Git branch.
*   **Final Design Review:** The entire site needs to be tested to ensure all design changes and bug fixes have been applied correctly.
*   **Deployment:** The final, tested site can be deployed to Netlify.

## Known Issues
*   All known issues have been resolved.
