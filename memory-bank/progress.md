# Progress: Form Submission and Email Formatting Complete

## Current Status: Project Documentation Synchronized
The Memory Bank has been updated to accurately reflect the current state of the codebase. The project is in a "final polish" stage, with all known bugs resolved.

## What's Left to Build
*   **Commit Changes:** The recent design changes, bug fixes, and Memory Bank updates need to be committed to a new Git branch.
*   **Final Design Review:** The entire site needs to be tested to ensure all design changes and bug fixes have been applied correctly.
*   **Deployment:** The final, tested site can be deployed to Netlify.

## Known Issues
*   All known issues have been resolved.

## Recent Updates
*   **Internationalization:** A series of internationalization updates have been completed, including translating the timeline, pricing information, and FAQ page. Chinese subtext has been added to the FAQ page and centralized in the `chineseSubtext.ts` file for consistency. The pricing data has been refactored to use translation keys from the `svelte-i18n` library, removing hardcoded strings and centralizing all pricing-related translations in the locale files. The `PricingCard.svelte` component's interactive functionality was also restored and fully integrated with the `svelte-i18n` library. All pricing card information has been translated into all supported languages.
*   **Careers Page:** The careers page has been updated with salary information and a new `JobCard.svelte` component.
*   **Form Submission:** The admissions form now uses a client-side JavaScript function to handle form submissions. This function formats the "Desired Start Date" into a full sentence and creates a professional email template with a custom subject line and HTML body.
*   **Admissions Form Enhancement:**
    *   Implemented a client-side JavaScript function to "polish" form field values before submission.
    *   Added client-side validation for US phone number format.
    *   Added a redirect to a "thank you" page after successful form submission.
