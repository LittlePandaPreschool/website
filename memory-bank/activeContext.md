# Active Context: Final Polish and Pre-Deployment

## Current Focus: Finalizing All UI/UX Refinements and Preparing for Deployment
The project is in the final stages of a comprehensive redesign. The immediate focus is on polishing the UI, ensuring all functionality is working correctly, and preparing for a smooth deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Dynamic Hero Section:**
    - Created a new `PhotoWallHero.svelte` component to replace the static hero image with a dynamic, engaging photo wall.
    - The photo wall features a masonry-style grid of images that are in constant, subtle motion with a seamless vertical scroll.
    - Individual images within the grid update at random, staggered intervals, creating a "twinkling" effect.
    - The hero section periodically transitions to a single, full-screen "feature" image, creating a powerful focal point.
    - All animations and transitions are designed to be slow, smooth, and elegant, with a custom ease-in-and-out curve.
    - Created a reusable `FadingImage.svelte` component to ensure all images fade in gracefully as they load.
- **Global Font Update:** Changed the primary heading font from "Bebas Neue" to "Poppins" to improve readability and create a more modern, cohesive aesthetic. This change was applied globally by updating `tailwind.config.ts` and `+layout.svelte`.
- **"Our Blueprint for Brilliance" Redesign:**
    - Redesigned the section to remove the rectangular cards and place the content directly on the green background for a more open and visually appealing layout.
    - Improved the color contrast by changing the titles to white, making them more readable against the dark green background.
    - Added a dynamic hover effect that scales up each item and subtly lightens the background, creating a more interactive and polished user experience.
- **"Our Campuses" Section Added to Homepage:**
    - Created a new "Our Campuses" section on the homepage to display the different school locations.
    - Developed a reusable `LocationCard.svelte` component to display each campus's information, including an icon, name, age range, address, and calls-to-action.
    - Externalized the campus data to `src/lib/data/locations.ts` for easy management.
    - Added Chinese subtext to all campus information, including names, age ranges, and calls-to-action, to improve accessibility.
- **Admissions Page Redesign:**
    - Created a reusable `InfoCard.svelte` component to display information in a card-based format.
    - Restructured the "Extended Care" section to use the `InfoCard` component, arranging it in a 1-2-1 row layout.
    - Restyled the `InfoCard` component to have a green background, white centered text, and a hover effect.
    - Wrapped the "Flexible options" text in the "Our Growth Tiers" section in an `InfoCard` for a more cohesive design.
    - Added a hover effect to the `PricingCard.svelte` component to improve interactivity.
- **Code Refactoring and Organization:**
    - Consolidated all static assets into the `website/static/` directory.
    - Refined the component organization by creating subdirectories for `layout`, `ui`, and `home`.
    - Externalized the careers page data to `src/lib/data/careers.ts`.
    - Removed the redundant `website/srcr/` directory.
- **Bug Fixes:**
    - Resolved recurring PostCSS errors in `Timeline.svelte` and `PandaButton.svelte` by removing the `lang="postcss"` attribute from the `<style>` tags.
    - Addressed an accessibility warning in the `Header.svelte` component by adding an `aria-label` to the menu button.
    - Removed unused CSS selectors from the `faq/+page.svelte` file.
    - Resolved accessibility warnings in the photo gallery and hero section by using more descriptive `alt` text and empty `alt` attributes for decorative images.
- **Pricing Button and Image Carousel Adjustments:**
    - Adjusted the positioning of the text within the paw-shaped pricing buttons on the admissions page to ensure it is properly centered.
    - Extended the height of the image carousel on the main page to fill the empty space at the bottom of the section.

## Next Steps
1.  **Commit Changes:** Create a new Git branch and commit all the recent design changes and bug fixes.
2.  **Final Design Review:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the entire site to ensure all design changes and bug fixes have been applied correctly.
3.  **Deploy to Netlify:** Once the site is fully tested and approved, the `website/build` directory can be deployed to Netlify.
