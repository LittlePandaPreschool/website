# Active Context: Final Polish and Pre-Deployment

## Current Focus: Finalizing All UI/UX Refinements and Preparing for Deployment
The project is in the final stages of a comprehensive redesign. The immediate focus is on polishing the UI, ensuring all functionality is working correctly, and preparing for a smooth deployment.

## Recent Changes
- **Image Optimization:**
    - Implemented lazy loading on the `ImageCarousel.svelte` component to improve performance.
    - Created multiple sizes of each image in the `hero` and `gallery` directories.
    - Updated the `DynamicHero.svelte` and `ImageCarousel.svelte` components to use responsive images with `image-set` and `srcset`, respectively.
- **Dynamic Image Loading:**
    - Updated the `DynamicHero.svelte` component to dynamically load all images from the `/static/img/hero/` directory using Vite's `import.meta.glob` feature.
    - Updated the `+page.svelte` file to dynamically load all images from the `/static/img/gallery/` directory and pass them to the `ImageCarousel` component.
- **Dynamic Hero Section:**
    - Replaced the previous "photo wall" hero concept with a full-screen, Ken Burns-style animated hero (`DynamicHero.svelte`).
    - The hero section now cycles through a series of high-quality images with a slow, elegant zoom and pan effect.
    - Transitions between images are handled with a smooth fade, creating a polished and engaging user experience.
    - Created a reusable `FadingImage.svelte` component to ensure all images fade in gracefully as they load.
- **Global Font Update:** Changed the primary heading font from "Bebas Neue" to "Poppins" to improve readability and create a more modern, cohesive aesthetic. This change was applied globally by updating `tailwind.config.ts` and `+layout.svelte`.
- **"Our Blueprint for Brilliance" Redesign:**
    - Redesigned the section to remove the rectangular cards and place the content directly on the green background for a more open and visually appealing layout.
    - Improved the color contrast by changing the titles to white, making them more readable against the dark green background.
    - Added a dynamic hover effect that scales up each item and subtly lightens the background, creating a more interactive and polished user experience.
- **"Our Campuses" Section Added to Homepage:**
    - Created a new "Our Campuses" section on the homepage to display the different school locations.
    - Developed a reusable `LocationCard.svelte` component to display each campus's information, including an icon, name, age range, address, and calls-to-action.
    - Externalized the campus data to `src/lib/data/locations.ts` for easy management.
    - Added Chinese subtext to all campus information, including names, age ranges, and calls-to-action, to improve accessibility.
- **Admissions Page Redesign:**
    - Created a reusable `InfoCard.svelte` component to display information in a card-based format.
    - Restructured the "Extended Care" section to use the `InfoCard` component, arranging it in a 1-2-1 row layout.
    - Restyled the `InfoCard` component to have a green background, white centered text, and a hover effect.
    - Wrapped the "Flexible options" text in the "Our Growth Tiers" section in an `InfoCard` for a more cohesive design.
    - Added a hover effect to the `PricingCard.svelte` component to improve interactivity.
- **Code Refactoring and Organization:**
    - Consolidated all static assets into the `website/static/` directory.
    - Refined the component organization by creating subdirectories for `layout`, `ui`, and `home`.
    - Externalized the careers page data to `src/lib/data/careers.ts`.
    - Removed the redundant `website/srcr/` directory.
- **Bug Fixes:**
    - Fixed a layout issue in the `ImageCarousel.svelte` component by dynamically distributing images across the four columns, ensuring a balanced and visually appealing layout.
    - Resolved recurring PostCSS errors in `Timeline.svelte` and `PandaButton.svelte` by removing the `lang="postcss"` attribute from the `<style>` tags.
    - Addressed an accessibility warning in the `Header.svelte` component by adding an `aria-label` to the menu button.
    - Removed unused CSS selectors from the `faq/+page.svelte` file.
    - Resolved accessibility warnings in the photo gallery and hero section by using more descriptive `alt` text and empty `alt` attributes for decorative images.
- **Pricing Button and Image Carousel Adjustments:**
    - Adjusted the positioning of the text within the paw-shaped pricing buttons on the admissions page to ensure it is properly centered.
    - Extended the height of the image carousel on the main page to fill the empty space at the bottom of the section.
- **Image Carousel Refactor:**
    - Refactored the `ImageCarousel.svelte` component to be responsive.
    - On mobile devices, the carousel now displays a single-column stack of wider, rectangular images.
    - On desktop devices, the carousel displays a 4-column grid with bi-directional scrolling.
- **Careers Page Update:**
    - Updated salary information in the careers data.
    - Created a reusable `JobCard.svelte` component to display job postings with salary information.
    - Updated the careers page to use the new `JobCard.svelte` component.
    - Updated the styling of the `JobCard.svelte` component to give it a more physical, card-like appearance.
    - Corrected the salary information for the Assistant Teacher and Teacher Aide positions to reflect a more logical progression.
    - Updated the salaries to be a range instead of a specific number.
    - Added hours to the job postings.
    - Added Chinese translations to the job postings.
- **Content Management Improvement:**
    - Created a centralized configuration file at `src/lib/data/siteConfig.ts` to manage site-wide data like the contact email address.
    - Refactored the website to use the new configuration file, making it easier to update the email address in the future.
- **Email Sending Improvement:**
    - Implemented a client-side JavaScript function to handle form submissions.
    - The function formats the "Desired Start Date" into a full sentence.
    - The function creates a professional email template with a custom subject line and HTML body.
    - The function submits the formatted data to Netlify Forms.
- **Form Handling Simplification:**
    - Removed the serverless function and custom JavaScript for form handling.
    - Reverted to a simple HTML form setup that uses Netlify's built-in form handling.
- **Form Validation:**
    - Added HTML5 validation to the forms on the homepage, admissions, and careers pages to enforce constraints on email, phone number, and date of birth fields.
- **Form Usability:**
    - Added a placeholder to the date of birth field on the homepage to improve user experience.
- **Admissions Form Enhancement:**
    - Implemented a client-side JavaScript function to "polish" form field values before submission.
    - Added client-side validation for US phone number format.
    - Added a redirect to a "thank you" page after successful form submission.
- **Internationalization:**
    - Translated all language files to their corresponding languages.
    - Ensured Chinese subtext is present in all language files.
    - Fixed hardcoded text in the homepage form.
    - Internationalized the `Timeline.svelte` component to use `svelte-i18n` for titles.
    - Internationalized the pricing information on the admissions page, including updating the data structure in `pricing.ts` and the `PricingCard.svelte` component.
    - Centralized all Chinese subtext for the FAQ page into `chineseSubtext.ts` and updated the `faq/+page.svelte` component to use it.
    - Added Chinese subtext to the "Collapse All" and "Expand All" buttons on the FAQ page.
    - Refactored the `pricing.ts` data to use translation keys from the `svelte-i18n` library, removing hardcoded strings and centralizing all pricing-related translations in the locale files.
    - Restored the interactive functionality of the `PricingCard.svelte` component, which was lost during the initial refactoring. The component now correctly displays dynamic pricing based on user selection and is fully integrated with the `svelte-i18n` library for translations.
    - Completed the internationalization of the pricing card by translating the pricing information into all supported languages.
